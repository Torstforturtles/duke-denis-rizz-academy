I didn't know what other name to put. I have no idea how to use GitHub lol so uh, code dump I guess?

================================

I found github after trying to learn some languages and thought it was kinda neat.

current experience as of 5/11/2025 (mm/dd/yyyy):
- Lua: decent, room for improvement
- Javescript: just starting
- Python: just starting
- c & c++: what the fuck

================================
